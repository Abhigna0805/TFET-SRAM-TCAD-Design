# Ultra-Compact TFET-Based SRAM Design (TCAD)

This project studies an ultra-low-power Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) design using
Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) to address leakage power and voltage scaling
limitations in conventional CMOS memory.

TFETs operate using band-to-band tunneling, enabling steeper subthreshold slopes and
reliable operation at much lower supply voltages, making them well-suited for
energy-constrained systems.

## What Was Done
- Analyzed a compact **3-transistor TFET-based SRAM cell** targeting low-leakage and
  low-voltage operation.
- Studied device behavior and memory stability under aggressive voltage scaling.
- Evaluated leakage, static noise margin, and scalability trade-offs compared to CMOS SRAM.

## Tools and Methods
- **TCAD-based analysis** for device- and circuit-level behavior
- Study of tunneling mechanisms, biasing strategies, and material considerations

## Why It Matters
The findings highlight how TFET-based SRAM architectures can significantly reduce standby
power while maintaining stable data storage, making them promising for future low-power
VLSI systems such as IoT, wearable devices, and edge computing platforms.
